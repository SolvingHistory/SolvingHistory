Χοιροκοιτία:
-Do you know how people here used to ensure their necessary goods to survive? But be careful, the solution is fluffy, pointy and try not 
to cut yourself. (αρνί, τόξο, τσεκούρι)
-Do you know how the roofs were made? A carpenter, a stockbreeder and a farmer can tell you that right away. (ξύλα, άχυρο, χώμα)
-They also had flour, but the question is how did the make it? The question is so obvious you might even say is under 
your nose in your back yard. (μύλος στην αυλή)
-Now i need you to find how they cooked. They obviously didn't have ovens, it's more like central heating. (εστία στο κέντρο του σπιτιού)
-You've found their "gril", next you have to find how the smoke ecaped the house. If you don't Santa won't be coming for you this year,
but even if you can't solve this one you need to keep your head high, it's a tough one. (μικρό άνοιγμα για να βγαίνει ο καπνός) 
-Because of the river nearby the danger of floods was high, but they found a way to protect themselfes from that. Mind your step.

(πυρόλιθος -μαύρος-, ασβεστόλιθος -άσπρος-, οστά)
-Their burial habits were strange, at least for us. They wanted to keep them close so that they'll still be a part of the family. (μέσα στο
σπίτι)

Καλαβασός-Τέντα:
-In this area the resients were a bit more atistic than Choirokitia. They had a better interior design taste. (φιγούρες με βαμένα κόκκινα 
και υψωμένα τα χέρια σχεδιασμένες στους τοίχους)
-Their home security systems were updated. Or they just didn't like their neighboors so they set limits. (τοίχος γύρο από το σπίτι)
-They also had some extra natural resources that are still used in modern day, mostly by builders. They used them on the walls and floors
(γύψος)
